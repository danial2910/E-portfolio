							<p>During my studies in UTM, I've developed and published many works. Do check each one out!:</p>
							<h1>Report</h1>
							<p>The first assignment that I have done with my teammate is a research about <a href="Assignment1.pdf">"Comparative Evaluation Websites Using Google Lighthouse Matrix."</a> 
							<p><h1>Reflection</h1>I have learned a great deal about the functionality, best practices, SEO, accessibility, and Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities of some of the most popular websites, such as Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb, Tripadvisor, Kayak and Agoda from this report. I was able to evaluate and compare these platforms objectively using the Google Lighthouse tool, which improved my comprehension of how these variables affect user experience and site optimisation. My technical understanding of web speed optimisation has increased as a result of this comparative study, which also made clear how crucial it is to follow best practices in web construction and maintain accessibility. A wider range of metrics could be added to the assignment to make it better by offering a more thorough evaluation. An examination of the user engagement and retention rates in conjunction with the Google Lighthouse scores, for example, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of each platform.</p>
							</p>
							<h1>Website</h1>
							<p>The next Project that I have done is A personal website and also a project on developing a Student Support and Counseling System. Do check both of them out : <a href="Assignment2/index.html">1.My Personal Website </a> <a href="https://appt-book.000webhostapp.com/CalmCounsel/appt.html">2.My Project.</a></p>
							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>I've learned a lot from working on my personal website project, which has helped me utilise and improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities to make a functional and aesthetically pleasing website. My comprehension of design principles, such as responsive design, user interface (UI) design, and user experience (UX), has deepened. Additionally, my proficiency with many web development technologies and tools has grown. In addition, the project gave me a stage on which to present my initiatives, abilities, and portfolio to prospective employers and partners. I propose improving SEO tactics, adding more sophisticated features like animations and interactive elements, putting in place a user feedback system, and concentrating on performance optimisation as future improvements. This project also demonstrated the significance of ongoing education, the satisfaction I get from seeing a concrete example of my abilities, the usefulness of the website as a networking tool, and the requirement for appropriate documentation.
							</p>
							I was able to use front-end and back-end technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, to construct a viable appointment booking platform through the extensive work of the student support and counseling website project. In addition to building features that improve the counseling system experience, I also developed important insights into user needs and behaviours and sharpened my UI/UX abilities by producing an interface that is clear, appealing, and easy to use. Through the project, I also improved my database design and management abilities, which will help me store and retrieve appointment listings and user data more effectively. I propose a number of potential enhancements, including the addition of features to increase user engagement, the implementation of more complex search and filter choices, mobile device optimisation, and improved security measures to safeguard user data. This project gave me the opportunity to put my talents to use in the real world, emphasised the value of teamwork and communication, underlined the necessity of adaptability, and demonstrated potential for future development and potential launch as a paid service.
							</p>	
							<p>
							Both projects helped me learn the value of efficient time management and prioritisation, how to balance multiple duties to meet deadlines, and how to solve problems by putting me in situations where I had to come up with original and practical answers. They stressed the need of comprehensive documentation, which makes it simpler to review and update projects later on, and the significance of feedback integration, realising that user input is essential to success and ongoing progress.
							</p>
							<h1>E-Portfolio</h1>
							<p>This is the latest project that I have done which is to make an E-portfolio project to showcase my Works and projects. Check Them Out!: <a href="index.html">E-Portfolio</a></p>
							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>I learned a lot from creating my e-portfolio, which has greatly improved my technical and professional abilities. It gave me the chance to demonstrate my work and hone my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills at the same time. I gained knowledge about the value of project presentation and documentation as well as the necessity of updating and managing the portfolio on a regular basis through this process. I was able to make sure that my portfolio was not only aesthetically pleasing but also easily navigable and intuitive by gaining an understanding of user experience design principles. Going forward, I want to include more interactive components and maintain consistency in my branding. I also want to ask for input so that I can keep becoming better and adjust to new trends.
